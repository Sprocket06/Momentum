# Momentum
This is a set of c# bindings for [cute_c2.h](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers/blob/master/cute_c2.h), and the resullting abstract layer.
The raw bindings are available through `using static Momentum.cute_c2`, and everything else is available normally.

## Documentation
This currently doesn't exist because this library is not yet in a complete enough state where I feel comfortable writing docs for it.
Most things should be relatively self-explanatory if you read through the source.
